One day after reaching my class I recalled, "I forgot my notebook", ofcourse i had a mobile but unfourtunately without a note taking app and When i tried downloading one, the internet became so slow that it was taking so long to download! I was like damn, I'll go home today and build my own lightweight note taking app!
